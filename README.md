Welcome to my **digital dumpster fire** of code.  
This repo is basically my **whiteboard / scrapbook / junk drawer** — I write whatever the hell I want, whenever I want, and push it here.  

Sometimes it’s genius, sometimes it’s garbage, sometimes I don’t even remember why I wrote it. But hey, future me might find it useful… or not.  

---

## 🚀 Why does this exist?
- Because my brain throws out random code at 2 AM  
- Because sometimes I reinvent the wheel… badly  
- Because not every repo has to be a polished portfolio piece  
- Because **“push first, think later”** is a lifestyle

## ⚡ How to use it?
You don’t  !! 
######

But if you insist:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kunal70616c/Code_Graveyard.git
cd Code_Graveyard
```

Then pick a folder, run some code, and question your life choices.

📝 Final Thoughts

This is not LeetCode.
This is not HackerRank.
This is not even Stack Overflow copy-paste.
This is Code_Graveyard — where snippets go to die, and occasionally, to be resurrected.

✨ Enjoy the chaos. Or don’t. I don’t care.
